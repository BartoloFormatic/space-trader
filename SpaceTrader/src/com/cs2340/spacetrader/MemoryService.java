/**
 * Note that both the methods in this class are static methods. Do not
 * instantiate an object of this class. Only one game can be saved at a time.
 * Calling savedGame() overwrites any previously saved game.
 * 
 * How to use this class to save and load a SpaceTrader game:
 * 
 * 
 * How to save a game: Step 1: Create a game state that you want to save. Use
 * SaveState class to capture the state of a game. The SaveState object wraps a
 * Map and a Player. SaveState state = new SaveState(map, player); Step 2: Call
 * the saveGame() method. This method takes two parameters: the SaveState object
 * you created in Step 1 and the present Context MemoryService.saveGame(state,
 * context); Step 3: Write a Toast to the user indicating if the save was
 * successful. The method returns true if save was successful, else returns
 * false.
 * 
 * How to load the last saved game: Step 1: Create a SaveState variable. Lets
 * call this "state". The load() method takes in this variable. If the method
 * returns successfully, this variable will point to the current state of the
 * game. SaveState state; // this will point to null at this point. Step 2: Call
 * loadGame(). This takes two parameters. The SaveState field you created in
 * Step 1 and the present context. If the loadGame() method returns false, note
 * that the "state" you passed in still POINTS TO NULL.
 * MemoryService.loadGame(state, context); Step 3: Indicate if the load was
 * successful depending on the boolean returned by the method.
